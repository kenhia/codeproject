# codeproject
Some example code for an article I'm thinking about for CodeProject.

At work I use PowerShell quite heavily, but C# remains an important tool especially when I need to take
a tool off my personal desktop and make it available to others. Lately I've come around to the power of
using PS with my C# code resulting in a sum that is greater than it's parts.

The ability to maintain state and do ad-hoc manipulation of your data, especially when you can still
use your data as objects, quickly becomes something I wonder how I ever lived without it. I can do
rapid prototyping in PS and then move critical bits into C#.

NB: with my work schedule right now, this directory is apt to grow slowly, but I will attempt to push
something into it nightly until I have a decent end-to-end example. Will probably spend some evenings
writing some drafts of the article.
